## How to use

<i>Note: There are 2 scripts for OTOMOTO â€” they're the same except for the URL. Using both files (or creating `otomoto3.py`, `otomoto4.py`, etc.) is useful when looking for a car in different location or using different search criteria altogether. Same applies for OLX.</i> 

### macOS 
How to chain the scripts:
```sh
# automate.sh
cd "PATH/otomoto_olx-scraper/otomoto1"
python3 otomoto1.py
cd ..
cd otomoto2
python3 otomoto2.py
cd .. 
cd olx1
python3 olx1.py
cd .. 
cd olx2
python3 olx2.py
```
Add ^ to Automator, export as Application and then run in the background via Script Editor.
